I wanted to talk about the idea that the beam can be your entire application. I'm excited. I can't wait to see you. to tackle server ability which is like kind of my hobby outside of. like actual work stuff. And it still continues to blow my mind when I use tools like LiveView. those patterns that you know blew my mind back then continue to blow my mind now and I see how easy it is to build these applications. If you can build that even if there are small places that leak out of that extraction like you know components I don't think we have exactly right yet It's still a huge win, and that's where we are right now, I think.
